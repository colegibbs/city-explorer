# City Explporer

**Author**: Cole Gibbs
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
As of lab 06, this application will be able to accept user input to call the LocationIQ API so the user can see exact long and lat of the city entered. There will also be a map of the city entered. If an error occurs there will be a message that display the error code for that error.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Users will have to close my git repo from GitHub and in their terminal run an 'npm i' to download the proper files for this project. They would then have to enter 'npm start' to see the live server.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
I am going to be using React.js, Axios, and React-Bootstrap.There will be a component called App.js which will be the main componenet and there will also be a Input.js to deal with the form for this lab.The form will change state on App.js and the Api call will be made in App.js.
